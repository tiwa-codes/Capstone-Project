# COVID-19 Prediction Project

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for the **Predictive Modeling for COVID-19 in Public Health** project. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using historical COVID-19 data to forecast cases, predict trends, and provide actionable insights for public health decisions.

### **Project Overview**
COVID-19 has impacted global health, and accurate prediction models can assist health organizations in planning and resource allocation. This project focuses on building a predictive model using data from various countries and regions. The data includes the number of cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination rates.

### **Key Steps in the Project**
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features based on the data.
3. **Model Development**: Building predictive models and evaluating their performance.
4. **Visualization & Insights**: Analyzing the results using visualizations and generating insights.

### **Repository Structure**
- **`project.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook that contains the entire project code, including data loading, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **`covid_19_clean_complete.csv`**: Raw dataset containing COVID-19 data (provided).
- **`outputs/`**: Folder where you can store outputs such as model predictions and visualizations.
  - **`predictions/`**: Store predicted results.
  - **`plots/`**: Store visualizations.
  - **`metrics/`**: Store model evaluation metrics.

### **Project Setup**
To run this project, you need to set up a Python environment and install the necessary libraries. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tiwa-codes/Capstone-Project.git
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd Capstone-Project
4. **Install required libraries: You can install the required libraries by using pip. It's recommended to use a virtual environment for this project**.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
6. **Run the Jupyter notebook: Once the libraries are installed, you can open and run the notebook project.ipynb**:
   ```bash
    jupyter notebook project.ipynb

# Requirements
The following Python packages are required for the project:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
xgboost: For building the predictive model.
matplotlib & seaborn: For generating visualizations.
You can find the full list of dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

Output
Upon successful completion of the notebook, the following outputs are generated:

Model Predictions: The predicted COVID-19 cases and other relevant metrics.
Visualizations: Charts and graphs depicting trends in the data, model performance, and key insights.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and others.
